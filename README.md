The original implementation of AdaBelief is in:

https://juntang-zhuang.github.io/adabelief/

This is my matlab implementation of the AdaBelief which is much simpler than the python version. Meanwhile, a toy DNN model along with real-world example are includeded. Noted that makeDataTensor.m, extractNoise.m, countmember.m are data processing modules solely for the real-world example.

Remember to download dataset from the following urls if you want to run the AdaBeliefOnRealData.m
